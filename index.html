        <h2>Who is V?</h2>
        <p id="tribute-info">V is the mysterious morally ambiguous anarchistic main character of Alan Moore and David Lloyd's comic book series <i>V for Vendetta</i>. He is a vigilante and freedom fighter striving to topple a totalitarian regime in a dystopian United Kingdom. His most recognizable traits are his Guy Fawkes mask, long hair and dark clothing.</p>
        <p>While V's true identity and background are never revealed, we do know that at one point he was an inmate at "Larkhill Resettlment Camp." Larkhill was one of many concentration camps run by Norsefire--the fascist dictatorship ruling Britain. These concentration camps were responsible for the extermination of countless Jews, Muslims, beatniks, liberals, homosexuals and people of color. While at Larkhill V was one of a number of prisoners subjected to horrific medical experimentation. These experiments resulted in death for all who were subjected to them, except for "the man in room five".</p>
          <p>Instead of dying, V developed olympic physical abilities and an expanded intellect. V bided his time in Larkhill, gaining the trust of the officials. Eventually he was allowed to grow roses, raise crops and given access to surplus garden supplies. On a cold and stormy night he detonated a homemade bomb and escaped his cell. V would spend the next five years building his secret base, "The Shadow Gallery" and planning his revenge on Norsefire.<p>
